# Turael Boosting
Adds features to assist you when Turael boosting for slayer points.

## Features:
- Overlay tells you whether to go to Turael or your selected slayer master, as well as your streak
- Uses green text to indicate that you can grab a task from Turael
- Uses red text to indicate that you should NOT grab a task from Turael
- Configuration dropdown to select your slayer master
- Option to hide Assignment option from Turael

## Planned:
- Arrows directing you to the slayer master you should be getting a new task from, appearing when you don't have a task
- Integration with Shortest Path plugin for the above, particularly because it would allow the player get into a flow-state groove by removing thought from the whole process
